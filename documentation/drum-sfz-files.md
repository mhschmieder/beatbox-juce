title: "Drum SFZ files"
---
Sadly SFZero is not quite up to par and lacks many advanced features for proper
drum sounds reproduction.
You can more or less use the drumkits from the good people over at AVLinux
directly (see [here]) and they sound OK.
You can also host the BeatBox plugin and use any drum library out there; there
are very good free ones, most notably [this one].
Note that hosting the plugin means that the tempo is synced to the host tempo
though, so it's sometimes impractical; working on adding an option to lift this.
There are other SFZ libraries out there, and you can quite easily create
your own since SFZ files are just description files for samples.
Improving SFZero or rewriting an SFZ plugin is in my pipeline, so stay tuned.
